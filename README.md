1. Use separation of variables to solve the partial differential equation

subject to boundary conditions
ux(0, y) = ux(π, y) = 0 for 0 < y < 1 and
u(x, 0) = 0, u(x, 1) = f(x) for 0 < x < π.
You may assume the eigenvalues are real, but should consider the three possible cases of negative, zero and positive eigenvalues.
2. Consider the regular Sturm–Liouville eigenproblem for 0 ≤ x ≤ 1 ,
u'' + λu = 0,
subject to boundary conditions
u(0) = 0 , u(1) + u ′ (1) = 0 .
(a) Verify the following properties:
i. There are an infinite number of eigenvalues, with no largest eigenvalue.
Hint: Consider the three cases λ = −k2, λ = 0 and λ = k2. Sketch or plot the graphs of y = tan k and y = −k for the case λ = k2.
ii. The nth eigenfunction has n − 1 zeros in 0 < x < 1 .
(b) Write down the orthogonality condition for the eigenfunctions.
3. Consider conduction of heat along a nonuniform. rod of length L. Let u(x, t) denote the temperature at position x along the rod and time t. The temperature satisfies the PDE

where the density ρ, specific heat c, thermal conductivity κ and coefficient α are all positive continuous functions of x. Suppose the temperature at one代 写MATHS 3023/4123/7107 Partial Differential Equations & Waves Written Assignment 2Python

u(0, t) = 0       and       ux(L, t) = 0.                                                                                   (3)
The initial temperature is
u(x, 0) = f(x),                                        (4)
where f(x) is a piecewise smooth function for 0 ≤ x ≤ L.
(a) Let u(x, t) = F(x)G(t). Use separation of variables to obtain two odes, one for F(x) and the other for G(t). Show that the ode for F(x) can be written in Sturm–Liouville form.

where λ is the separation constant and p(x), q(x) and r(x) are functions that you should write in terms of ρ, c, κ and α.
(b) Write down the corresponding boundary conditions for F(x).
(c) Let λn and Fn(x) denote the eigenvalues and corresponding eigenfunctions for n = 1, 2, . . . Use the Rayleigh quotient to show that the eigenvalues λn are positive.
(d) Write down a solution of the pde (2) subject to boundary conditions (3) and initial condition (3) in terms of λn and Fn(x). Use the properties of Sturm–Liouville prob-lems to derive any formulae needed to compute any coefficients. You do not need to determine λn or Fn(x) for this question.
(e) What happens to the temperature as t → ∞? Justify your answer.
